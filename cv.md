I am 25 years old and just learning web-developer. At the moment, my goal is to learn to be a Full-stack developer. I already know and understand that it will be difficult for me, but I am serious, so there is nowhere to go.
I graduated from higher education with a degree in Physical Education and Life Safety. At the moment I work in the committee for physical culture in the Leningrad region. My path and my goal is to change my profession in a year or two.
At school, I did not like to study English, so I can write this text with errors. And with the study of the profession of web-developer, I realized that English is a must. And at the moment I'm studying web-developer and English at the same time. Difficult but what can you do.
