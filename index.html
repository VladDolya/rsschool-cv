					<h2>My Bio</h2>
				</header>
					<p class="paragraph">I am 25 years old and just learning web-developer. At the moment, my goal is to</p>
					<p>learn to be a Full-stack developer. I already know and understand that it</p>
					<p>will be difficult for me, but I am serious, so there is nowhere to go.</p>
					<p>I graduated from higher education with a degree in Physical Education</p>	
					<p>and Life Safety. At the moment I work in the committee for physical culture in</p>	 
					<p>the Leningrad region. My path and my goal is to change my profession in a year or two.</p>
					<p>At school, I did not like to study English, so I can write this text with errors.</p>
					<p>And with the study of the profession of web-developer i realized that English is a must.</p>
					<p>And at the moment I'm studying web-developer and English at the same time.</p>
					<p>Difficult but what can you do.</p>
